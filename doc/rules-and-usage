RULES TO FOLLOW

1. An explicit exclude trumps any other include

   That is, if Victor is both Owner and Requestor on a ticket, and the
   Requestor is included in a notification but the Owner is excluded,
   Victor won't receive that notification.

2. Each row in the matrix sends email independent of the others

3. "When a ticket is updated externally" is a subset of "When a ticket
   is replied to"

   This means if both rows are included for a role, two emails about the
   reply will be generated.  "When a ticket is updated externally" means
   replied to by anyone not a Cc or Owner (usually the requestor or another
   team member (AdminCc) who isn't the Owner or Cc'd on the ticket).

   Note that when sending email, external means to Requestors and Ccs.

4. Roles considered external get a separate email (and sometimes different
   template) than roles considered internal.  See the table below.  Someone who is
   getting an internal notification however will not also get an external one.

5. Multiple includes on a single row don't generate duplicates.


TABLE OF ROLES

 Role      | Appears in | External?
--------------------------------
 Requestor | To         | yes
 Cc        | Cc         | yes
 Owner     | To         | no
 AdminCc   | Bcc        | no


TEMPLATES

Requestors and Ccs get external notifications, Owners and AdminCcs get
internal ones.

Queue-level templates with the same name, if they exist, are used in
preference to global ones.  This means the first template name is looked
for on the ticket's queue, and then globally.  Then the second template
name is looked for on the queue, and then globally.  Et cetera.  The
first one found is used.
