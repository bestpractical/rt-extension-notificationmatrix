NAME
    RT::Extension::NotificationMatrix - RT Extension for custom ticket
    notification

SYNOPSIS
      # In your RT site config:
      Set(@Plugins,(qw(RT::Extension::NotificationMatrix));
      # If you'd like to Bcc all recipients, uncomment the line below.
      # Disabled by default.
      #Set($NotificationMatrixAlwaysBcc, 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides per-queue configuration for notification triggering
    based on ticket actions, and notification delivery for selected ticket
    roles and/or user-defined groups.

    Note that this plugin can co-exist with the RT::Scrip-based
    notification, which you probably want to disable to avoid duplicated
    messages.

    When the plugin is enabled, you will have an additional Notification tab
    in the queue admin page. When a notification rule is triggered, the
    designated ticket roles or user defined groups get a message with the
    first found template of:

    $RuleName
        For example: TicketResolved

    The default tempalte defined by the rule
    The Transaction template

    Message sent to external recipients (requestors and ccs) will be using
    first found template of:

    $RuleName-External
        For example: TicketResolved-External

    The default external tempalte defined by the rule
    The Transaction template

CAVEATS
    Internally, the matrix is stored on the queue object as attributes, with
    mappings to the subscribe RT::Group object ids. The role groups are
    stored as queue-role groups, as at the time of configuration we do not
    have ticket instances to create ticket-role groups. The queue-role
    gorups are then instantiated as ticket-role when the notification rules
    are triggered.
